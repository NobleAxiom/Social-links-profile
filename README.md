### Built with

- CSS
- Javascript
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### What I learned

fro this project I was asked to upload the project to a live github public repository. I familiarized a refresher on using git terminal commands to to stage with "git add ." and commit with "git commit" while solidifying a understaanding difference in git running localy on my device compared to being synced with the cloud based platform github. also, I was able to usl HSL versus RGB in my CSS as that was the specifics provided, thus allowing me to grow with the bit of experiance. also, I was able to look in to adding a media tag for a resposive design adjustment.
